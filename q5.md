# Approach 1:
This approach defines a function doubleL(n) that takes an integer n as input. It then initializes an empty list res. Inside a loop that iterates n times, it appends the double of the loop index i to the res list. Finally, it returns the res list containing the doubled values. Outside the function, it iterates over the values returned by doubleL(5) and prints each value followed by a colon.

# Approach 2:
This approach utilizes list comprehension to achieve the same result as Approach 1. It generates a list by iterating over the range of numbers from 0 to 4 (inclusive) and multiplying each number by 2. Then, it iterates over this list and prints each value followed by a colon.

# Approach 3:
Here, doubleG(n) is a generator function. It's similar to Approach 1, but instead of storing all the doubled values in a list and returning them at once, it yields each doubled value one at a time as the loop iterates. This approach is memory efficient as it doesn't store all values in memory simultaneously, making it more suitable for large data sets.

Now, regarding the type of function doubleG(n): it's a generator function. The advantage of using such a function lies in memory efficiency. Unlike normal functions (like in Approach 1) that construct and return entire lists, generator functions yield values one at a time, on demand. This makes them particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or when memory usage needs to be optimized. Additionally, generator functions can be more readable and concise compared to manual iteration approaches.
